_BST Successor Search_
======================

In a Binary Search Tree (BST), an Inorder Successor of a node is defined as the node with the smallest key greater than the key of the input node (see examples below). Given a node inputNode in a BST, youâ€™re asked to write a function findInOrderSuccessor that returns the Inorder Successor of inputNode. If inputNode has no Inorder Successor, return null.

Explain your solution and analyze its time and space complexities.

In this diagram, the inorder successor of 9 is 11 and the inorder successor of 14 is 20.

Example:
In the diagram above, for inputNode whose key = 11

Your function would return:
The Inorder Successor node whose key = 12
